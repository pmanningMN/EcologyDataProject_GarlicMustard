# EcologyDataProject_GarlicMustard

Project overview: At the Ordway Field Station in Inver Grove Heights Minnesota, the invasive plant garlic mustard is studied. Study of the plant takes place yearly and involves taking 322 transects of the forest floor to produce data. These transects are approximately 20 meters long and measurements of individual patches are taken within each transect. For example a patch of garlic mustard may be measured 0.51-1.73 meters, and a patch of gooseberry at 1.68-2.41m. Furthermore, along the path obstacles that prevent any growth are noted and numbers of individual cases are noted as well (ex. number of Garlic mustard plants with aphid/pest damage).


GMTransectClean.md is a R markdown file of a process to clean the data coming from seperate field recording instruments. Main causes of data entry error are screened for to be caught before summary and analysis.
