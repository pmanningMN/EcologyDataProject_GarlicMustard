Project overview: At the Ordway Field Station in Inver Grove Heights Minnesota, the invasive plant garlic mustard is studied. Study of the plant takes place yearly and involves taking 322 transects of the forest floor to produce data. These transects are approximately 20 meters long and measurements of individual patches are taken within each transect. For example a patch of garlic mustard may be measured 0.51-1.73 meters, and a patch of gooseberry at 1.68-2.41m. Furthermore, along the path obstacles that prevent any growth are noted and numbers of invidiual cases are noted as well (ex. number of Garlic mustard plants with aphid/pest damage).

This Rmarkdown presents a solution to clean the data that is gathered in spreadsheet form in the field. An example of the raw data can be seen on my github.

Before you can clean the data, you must combine the 3-5 individual datatables generated in the field as one master dataframe. This can be done by reading each individual table as a laballed dataframe and combining them with rbind. uncomment and add the dataframe names into this. If you run into errors make sure the column names, counts and types are all the same. Location doesnt matter.

ALso make sure that the GMdataraw has columns labelled by type correctly, commonly the NUM\_APHID category does not autoset at an integer type.

``` r
#install.packages('tidyverse')
#install.packages("zoo")
#install.packages("knitr")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#library(dplyr)
library(zoo)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'zoo'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     as.Date, as.Date.numeric

``` r
#GMdataraw = rbind(dataframe1, dataframe2, dataframe3)
GMdataraw <- read.csv(file="GMdataraw.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")


save(GMdataraw, file="GMdataraw.RData")
load(file="GMdataraw.RData")
```

Each of the 322 transects taken of the forest floor can be located from it's southern-most end (transects run North-South), by GPS coordinates shorted to the last 3 digits.

The biggest error in past transect data has been transects that appear to be entirely missing on first glance. This is due to error in measurement orginially or mislablling on transects.

To solve this problem I build two lists that contains the ideal count of the transects at each given line (ex. at E-W latitude of 810 there should be 8 transects, and etc.). I did this for the E-W measurement of the transects and the N-S meaurements, so this can be compared to, to ensure that each has the correct amount at each coordinate.

``` r
Xfreq = data.frame("freq" = c(8, 8, 9, 9, 11, 11, 12, 12 ,13 ,11 ,11 ,10 ,11 ,11 ,12 ,12 ,14 ,14 ,14 ,14 ,14 ,14 , 14, 13, 14, 13, 13))

Yfreq= data.frame("freq" = c(9,9,18,25,27,27,27,27,25,23,23,21,19,15,13,11,3))
```

Now a function loops over each transect in order and prints a message if any transect counts do not match the above datasets.

This will identify the following errors: 1) too many or too few transects present in data (will print "This data should have 322 coordinates, but actually has X") 2) if any transect value along (X,Y) is not expected,( will print "X value is not expected check Y column.) 3) checks each line (X and Y) for too few or many transects at that line compared to the above lists (prints which line has the incorrect amount of transects)

``` r
CorrectNumTransects= function(data,lookAtCol,ReferenceDf,increment,lowval,highval){
#This function takes the raw data, specifically the isolated column (chosen through LookAtCol) and compares that list with one of the Xfreq/Yfreq lists. It returns a printed messages if either of these is incorrect. Coordinates increase in a +1 increment for X coordinates and +2 for Y coordinates so this is specified. It also makes sure that all coordinates points are between 810-836 and prints an error if there is a problem there.
  SelectedColumn=data[,c(lookAtCol)]     #Selects only target column
  ReferenceDfLength=nrow(ReferenceDf)    #Counts length of reference dataframe
  sGMsub = SelectedColumn[complete.cases(SelectedColumn), ]  #represents target column as booleans, should reveal a list with 322 TRUE to show presence of value.
  irow=nrow(sGMsub);
  if (any(sGMsub<lowval)|any(sGMsub>highval)) {print(paste0(sGMsub, ' is a value not in the range of ', lowval, ' to ', highval, ' double check ', lookAtCol ,' column'))};        #if any value in the target column is not between low val and high val an error message will print
  if (irow != 322) {print(paste0('This data should have 322 coordinates, but actually has ',irow))}
  xline=lowval 
  listorder=1
  for(i in 1:ReferenceDfLength){
    Whatis= sum(xline==sGMsub) #taking the sum of the number of times a number shows up in the raw data allows us to tell how many coordinates use that X/Y coordinate.
  ShouldBe= ReferenceDf[listorder,1]
  if (Whatis !=ShouldBe) {print(paste0('at ', xline, 
' the amount of coordinates in this line is incorrect. There should be ',ShouldBe, ' coordinated but this line has ',Whatis ))}
  xline= xline+ increment
  listorder= listorder + 1}
}

#Below are calls to the above function

#CorrectNumTransects(GMdataraw, 'X', Xfreq, 1, 810, 836)
#CorrectNumTransects(GMdataraw, 'Y', Yfreq, 2, 170, 202)
```

Now we quickly doublcheck that there are 322 instances of a value in the X column and in the Y column. We can also check that there are 322 instances of a transect tapemeasure START value and an END value.

``` r
varsub=GMdataraw[,c('Y')]
irow = sum(!is.na(varsub))
if (irow != 322){print(paste0('incorrect amount of ',var))}
```

``` r
Checkvar= function(GMdataraw,var){
#Takes raw data and a variable and make sure each only occurs as many times as the number of coordiantes(322)
varsub=GMdataraw[,c(var)]
irow = sum(!is.na(varsub))
if (irow != 322){print(paste0('incorrect amount of ',var))}
if (irow == 322){print(paste0('correct amount of ',var))}}

Checkvar(GMdataraw,'X');
```

    ## [1] "correct amount of X"

``` r
Checkvar(GMdataraw,'Y');
```

    ## [1] "correct amount of Y"

``` r
Checkvar(GMdataraw,'START');
```

    ## [1] "correct amount of START"

``` r
Checkvar(GMdataraw,'END')
```

    ## [1] "correct amount of END"

The next most major and common error is when the entered data has a end measurement shorter than the start measurement, where if it is not caught provides that transect with a negative value for the patch measurements.

This makes sure that: 1) The GM\_START is shorter than the GM\_END 2) The ROS\_START (Rosette start) is shorter than the ROS\_END 3) the STEM\_START is shorter than the STEM\_END 4) the MISC\_START is shorter than the MISC\_END

``` r
#The following Makes sure that the end point is at a longer distance than the start point

listchecks= function(GMdataraw){
#Makes a Boolean (TRUE FALSE) List checking whether the END is greater than the START for most distance variables. Then each list is checked to print on what lines there is a false answer to the listcheck
listcheck1 = GMdataraw$GM_END > GMdataraw$GM_START
listcheck2 = GMdataraw$ROS_END > GMdataraw$ROS_START
listcheck3 = GMdataraw$STEM_END > GMdataraw$STEM_START
listcheck4 = GMdataraw$MISC_END > GMdataraw$MISC_START


if (FALSE %in% listcheck1){
loca= which(listcheck1 == FALSE);
print(paste0('GM_end is smaller number than start at ',loca));
}

if (FALSE %in% listcheck2){
loca = which(listcheck2 == FALSE);
print(paste0('ROS_end is smaller number than start at ',loca));
}

if (FALSE %in% listcheck3){
loca=which(listcheck3 == FALSE);
print(paste0('STEM_end is smaller number than start at ',loca));
}

if (FALSE %in% listcheck4){
loca=which(listcheck4 == FALSE);
print(paste0('MISC_end is smaller number than start at ',loca))
}

print('All GM and MISC measured have an end that longer than the start')}


#Calls the above functions appropriately for X and Y
listchecks(GMdataraw)
```

    ## [1] "All GM and MISC measured have an end that longer than the start"

Once these above tests returns nothing the data is ready to be indexed and analyzed, all the necessary pre data corrections are done, without this the following functions will not work.

Now the data must be prepared which means that: 1) each row should have an X and Y coordinate to show what transect that data belongs to. 2) The measurements that are lengths are calculated by calculating (end - start). resulting in : ROS\_LENGTH, STEM\_LENGTH, GM\_LENGTH, MISC\_LENGTH 3) relevant values that were NA are now changed to 0: including, NUM\_APHID, NUM\_STEMS, NUM\_OTHER, NUM\_MINER, and the above lengths

``` r

#This will index each coordinate and make new columns for total lengths per segment

NewX=na.locf(ts(GMdataraw[,c('X')]))  #fills NAs with the last non-NA, making subsetting of coordinates possible.

    ## [1] "GM data is now indexed"

The data name GMdata is what has been indexed and initalized, GMdataraw is what is pre index and initalized.

Now we can ccheck to see that the GM measurements are in order and spaced appropriately. This means that we will check that 1) On a transect line, a later patch comes at a higher measurement than an earlier patch. 2) The distance between the patches is our standardized 0.20 m
